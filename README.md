Alexander Gustafsson, Jonatan Linberg

### Code Sources
 * The project is built around the **EMNIST** dataset, available from:
   * https://github.com/sorki/python-mnist
 * The initial **cGAN** and **FID** code (train_cgan.py) was developed by Jason Brownlee, available from: 
   * https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-conditional-generative-adversarial-network-from-scratch/ (cGAN)
   * https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-implement-the-frechet-inception-distance-fid-from-scratch/ (FID)

### Training a cGAN
Training a cGAN can be accomplished by running the train_cgan code, "python train_cgan.py <save_path>". The user can enter runtime parameters when prompted or load them from a file, "python train_cgan.py <save_path> <RTP-file>".

### Experiment Data
-- _To be added at a later date_ --

### Tools
#### Latent Space Explorer (lse.py)
##### Usage:
 * "python lse.py" and enter the model file when prompted or
 * "python lse.py <model.h5>"

The program features one slider for each latent dimension, for exploration the latent space. The user can define a vector in the space to traverse and even create an animation. 

#### Character Generator (char_gen.py)
##### Usage:
* "python char_gen.py -[options]"

The program can be used to generate characters and text using a generator model. A full list of options can be found by using the "-H" option. Can also evaluate the euclidean distance between the generated images and present them as a box plot.

#### Result plotting (plot_results.py)
##### Usage:
* "python plot_results.py <results_csv file>"

The program can present various graphs of the data collected from a training run.
